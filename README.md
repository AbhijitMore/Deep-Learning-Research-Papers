# üìö Deep Learning Research Papers

Welcome to my curated collection of deep learning research papers! I have a habit of reading a few papers each week to stay on top of the latest developments and ideas in the field. This repository serves as a personal archive of the papers I've read, with key insights and summaries to help you explore these influential works.

## üîç Computer Vision

1. **[You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://abhijitmore.github.io/posts/YoloV1/)**  
   A groundbreaking work that revolutionized object detection by introducing a single-stage detector, enabling real-time processing without compromising accuracy.

2. **[A Comprehensive Review of YOLO Architectures in Computer Vision: From YOLOv1 to YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS](https://abhijitmore.github.io/posts/A-Comprehensive-Review-of-YOLO-Architectures-in-Computer-Vision/)**  
   A deep dive into the evolution of YOLO architectures, tracking their advancements from the original YOLO to the latest state-of-the-art models, YOLO-NAS.

3. **[ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf)**  
   The pivotal paper that introduced AlexNet, sparking widespread use of deep learning in image classification and setting new performance benchmarks.

4. **[Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)**  
   This paper introduced the VGG network architecture, showcasing the importance of network depth in achieving high accuracy on large-scale image recognition tasks.

## üß† NLP

1. **[Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781)**  
   This paper laid the foundation for word2vec, a widely used method to learn word embeddings that capture semantic meanings of words in vector space.

2. **[Long Short-Term Memory](https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf)**  
   The seminal work that introduced LSTM, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and enabling effective learning of long-term dependencies in sequential data.
